Addings strings.

Should strings be stored in a specific memory location
or pushed onto the stack?

If stored in code memory:

OP_SCONST Hello, world\0


How to store string variables?

currently everything is stored as a 4-byte value.
maybe use char pointers as the 4-byte value.


Add a thing to load dynamic libraries for cfunc.
Maybe like this:
	clib "somewrapperlib";
